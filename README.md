GitHub Tutorial

Step 1: Setting up a GitHub account

You'll need a GitHub account to create a GitHub repository to store the revision in. If you already have a GitHub account, continue to Step 2: Creating a GitHub repository.
1. Go to https://github.com/join.
2. Enter a username, your email address, and a password.
3. Choose Sign up for GitHub and follow the instructions.

Step 2: Create a GitHub repository

1. On the GitHub home page, do one of the following:
- Under Your repositories, choose New repository.
- In the navigation bar, select Create new (+) and then choose New repository.
2. On the Create a new repository page, do the following:
- In the Repository name box, enter CodeDeployGitHubDemo.
- Select Public.
- Uncheck the Initialize this repository with a README box. Instead you will create a README.md file manually in the next step.
- Choose Create repository.
3. Follow the instructions for your local machine type to create the repository using the command line.

Step 3: Upload a sample app to the GitHub repository


Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

Branch: Shows the branches made from Master which are being worked on locally.

Clone: Creates a local copy of a project that already exists remotely. The clone includes all the codes, project’s files, history, and branches.

Commit:Saves the snapshot to the project history and completes the change-tracking process.

Fetch: This allows you download files and changes from the remote to your local repository. 

GIT: Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.

Github: GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.

Merge: Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. 

Merge Conflict: Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. 

Push: Updates the remote repository with any commits made locally to a branch.

Pull: Updates the local line of development with updates from its remote counterpart. 

Remote: This is the common repository all team members used to exchange their changes. 

Repository: A repository contains all of your project's files and each file's revision history.
